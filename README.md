# MSc Project

A collection of teaching tools designed to allow educators to produce web-oriented educational content. Current development focuses on Physics content specifically. Built using nwjs (previously node-webkit).

# Components (In Development)

## Markdown Editor

An editor for building the content, based around the Markdown language. Will incorporate live previews and MathML rendering of equations.

## Animator

A tool for creating animations and diagrams using the HTML5 canvas element. These will be embedded in the content created in the editor.

## Static Site Generator

Will allow the content to be exported as a static site, to then be hosted in a location chosen by the user.
